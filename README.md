# lacey.se-shinyapps
A repository for old Shiny (R) apps (previously) hosted at lacey.se: cell energy density calculator and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) interactive apps. These apps are a bit old and not kept updated, so I cannot guarantee they run without issue with current versions of R and the packages they use. At the time of committing this repository, the lacey.se server is running R 3.4.4, tidyverse 1.3.0 and shiny 0.13.2.

The apps included in this repository are:

- cell-energy - an energy density calculator for cylindrical alkali-ion (Li-ion, Na-ion etc) batteries
- eis/debye - an app for simulating the EIS response of a Debye equivalent circuit
- eis/randles - an app for simulating the EIS response of a Randles circuit
- eis/rc-rc - an app for simulating the EIS response of two parallel RC circuits connected in series
- eis/simulate-eis - an app for simulating any user-defined circuit
